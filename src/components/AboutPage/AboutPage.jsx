        <p>A huge shoutout to my instructor, Dane. Thank you for downloading all this
          code into my brain and for talking things out with me when the bees buzzed too
          loud.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And to my co-parent and partner, Isaac - thank you for being you. Word cannot express 
          how thankful I am that you were willing to take the large brunt of parenting our tiny
          hoomans while I furthered my career.
        </p>
